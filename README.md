# JUST FOR CHECKING OUT SYMFONY

I might develope this into a full project. I still need an api for an old electron api I created a few years back. However, I wanted to check out symfony and see how it works.

# Snippster

If ever finsihed this would be the API for the snippster app. Snippster is an application that allows you to store code snippets.
